# About myself

I'm an undergraduate, major: Computer Science (Blockchain Engineering).

I'm busy with my curricula, resulting in lack of time to pay attention to
my open-source projects. They may be stay unmaintained for some time. So
please get in contact with me if you have some important affairs which
should make me notified.
